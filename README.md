### **File Operations in Java using IntelliJ**  
**Project Description**

This project demonstrates basic file handling operations using **Java** on the **IntelliJ IDEA** platform. The primary objective is to perform **reading**, **writing**, and **modifying** text files through a console-based application. The program uses built-in Java libraries such as **java.io** and **java.nio.file** to efficiently manage file operations. The project follows an object-oriented approach where all file-related tasks are encapsulated inside a separate **FileHandler** class. The user interacts with the system through a menu-driven interface, allowing them to write new content, view existing content, or modify specific text within the file. This system ensures data persistence by appending or updating content directly into the text file. The project highlights the importance of file manipulation in backend applications, serving as a foundation for advanced applications like data storage, logging systems, and document management. The implementation is clean, modular, and beginner-friendly, making it an ideal learning project for understanding file operations in Java.
